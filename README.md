# 📱 Jetchat Nav3 Multi-Module Sample

This project demonstrates how to use **Jetpack Navigation 3** together with a **multi-module architecture** in a real-world Jetpack Compose app.

It is heavily based on the official **Jetchat** sample from Google and reuses a significant portion of its open-source code (Apache 2.0).

## ✨ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

-   Showcase **Jetpack Navigation 3**
    
-   Demonstrate **modularization in a Compose app**

    
----------

## 🧱 Architecture

### Multi-module setup

The project is split into independent modules to:

-   Improve build times
    
-   Enable feature isolation
    
-   Support scalability
    
-   Allow clearer ownership boundaries

Feature modules are using both API/Implementation and layer architecture - I am not guaranteing that it is the proper way but this repo served as a Gradle playground so I decided to go with it

The submodule structure looks like this:
 - feature:profile:api
 - feature:profile:impl:ui
 - feature:profile:impl:domain
 - feature:profile:impl:data
 
    

Example module responsibilities:

-   `core` → shared utilities, design system, common models
    
-   `feature:conversation` → conversation screen
    
-   `feature:profile` → profile UI
    
-   `app` → application entry point

-   `ui`  → Android resources related stuff (mainly just so submodules have something to depend on that isn't `:app`
    

### Navigation 3

This project uses **Jetpack Navigation 3** to:

-   Define type-safe destinations
    
-   Support modular navigation graphs
    
-   Enable better separation between features
    

The implementation follows the concepts presented in the droidcon session.

## 🧩 What comes from Jetchat

A large portion of the following is taken or adapted from the original sample:

-   UI components
    
-   ViewModels & state holders
    
-   Data models & fake repositories
    
-   Theming and design
    
-   Message input & conversation layout
    

This is possible thanks to the **Apache 2.0 license**.

## 🚀 Why this project exists

There is currently no official sample that:

✅ Uses **Navigation 3**  
✅ Is **multi-module**  
✅ Unofficial sample for the **droidcon** talk 

This repo fills that gap.
